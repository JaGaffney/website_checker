# website_checker

Allows a user to input a website and then have information returned to the user such as domain expiry, SSL expiry, SSL stats and status codes. This data would then be saved into a database for future access as well as automatic reminders when this information would expire. This was on a concept idea from the owner for a web development company 'Oakland Agencys' who wanted to see if it was possible to have this data displayed on a website as well as a Discord bot. May be developed in the future.
